I mess with red teaming, web hacking, and network stuff.  
Learning every day, not perfect, but I don't quit.  
Mostly self-taught. I build my own tools when I can’t find what I want.

Still learning C and getting deeper with Python.  
I break stuff down to understand it  that’s how I learn.

## Skills

- Web exploitation (XSS, CSRF, SQLi, SSRF, cache poisoning, etc)
- Networking attacks (WiFi, rogue APs, phishing, MITM)
- Decent at OPSEC and hiding files or traffic
- Not great at programming yet, but improving every day
- Tools I use: Burp Suite, Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, bettercap, Gobuster, SQLMap, assetfinder, dirb, etc

---

## Stuff I’ve Built / Working On

- `port-scanner`: GUI port scanner using sockets and Tkinter. Simple but works.
- `web-hacking-notes`: Writeups, payloads, testing ideas, and random notes from web hacking.
- `redteam-tools`: Scripts, recon stuff, and anything I’ve found useful or made.

---

## current Goals

- Building a basic .onion site for testing
- Learning more C so I can go lower level
- Eventually want to get into malware analysis and AV evasion

## When Im Active

Mainly at night, US Central time.  
I work, but I still make time to code or learn something.  
If I join a team, Im locked in.

I’m not here to look smart. I’m here to learn, build, and do shit that actually works.
